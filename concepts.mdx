# Key Concepts

This page explains the core concepts and terminology used in Hypr-Visor.

## Firecracker MicroVMs

Hypr-Visor is built on top of [Firecracker](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/), a virtual machine monitor (VMM) developed by AWS that enables secure, multi-tenant, minimal-overhead execution of container and function workloads.

<Note>
  Firecracker MicroVMs are lightweight virtual machines that provide the security and isolation of traditional VMs with the speed and efficiency of containers.
</Note>

Key characteristics of Firecracker MicroVMs:

- **Fast Boot Times**: MicroVMs can boot in as little as 125ms
- **Low Memory Overhead**: Each MicroVM adds only about 5MB of overhead
- **Strong Isolation**: Hardware-level isolation between workloads
- **Minimal Attack Surface**: Firecracker has a minimal device model and a small codebase

## Virtual Machines (VMs)

In Hypr-Visor, a VM represents a Firecracker MicroVM instance. Each VM has:

- **Resources**: vCPUs, RAM, and storage
- **Network Interface**: Connected to a virtual network
- **Operating System**: Based on a rootfs image
- **Lifecycle**: Can be created, started, stopped, restarted, and terminated

## Networking

Hypr-Visor provides networking capabilities for VMs through:

- **Bridge Network**: A virtual bridge that connects VMs to each other and optionally to the outside world
- **DHCP**: Automatic IP address assignment to VMs
- **Security Groups**: Firewall rules that control inbound and outbound traffic
- **Network Isolation**: VMs can be isolated in their own network segments

## Storage

Hypr-Visor offers flexible storage options:

- **Root Volumes**: The primary disk for each VM, based on a rootfs image
- **Data Volumes**: Additional persistent storage that can be attached to VMs
- **Snapshots**: Point-in-time copies of volumes for backup or cloning

## Clustering

Hypr-Visor can operate in a clustered mode, where multiple Hypr-Visor instances work together:

- **Nodes**: Individual Hypr-Visor instances in the cluster
- **Leader Election**: Automatic selection of a leader node
- **Distributed State**: Shared state across all nodes
- **Resource Allocation**: Intelligent placement of VMs across nodes

## High Availability (HA)

Hypr-Visor provides high availability features to ensure VM uptime:

- **HA Policies**: Rules that define how VMs should be protected
- **Auto Restart**: Automatic restart of failed VMs
- **Failover**: Moving VMs to another node if the current node fails
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of VM health

## Live Migration

Live migration allows moving a running VM from one host to another without downtime:

- **State Transfer**: Copying the VM's memory and device state
- **Minimal Downtime**: The VM continues running during most of the migration
- **Bandwidth Control**: Limiting the network bandwidth used for migration
- **Compression**: Reducing the amount of data transferred

## Performance Optimization

Hypr-Visor includes features to optimize VM performance:

- **CPU Pinning**: Dedicating physical CPU cores to specific VMs
- **Huge Pages**: Using larger memory pages for better performance
- **I/O Priority**: Prioritizing disk I/O for critical VMs
- **Network QoS**: Controlling network bandwidth and latency

## Monitoring and Alerting

Hypr-Visor provides comprehensive monitoring and alerting:

- **Metrics**: Collection of performance metrics from hosts and VMs
- **Thresholds**: Configurable thresholds for alerting
- **Alerts**: Notifications when thresholds are exceeded
- **Dashboards**: Visual representation of system status

## API and CLI

Hypr-Visor can be controlled through:

- **REST API**: A comprehensive HTTP API for programmatic control
- **CLI**: A command-line interface for easy management
- **Dashboard**: A web-based UI for visual management
