# Authentication

All API requests to Hypr-Visor require authentication using a token-based approach.

## API Tokens

Hypr-Visor uses a simple token-based authentication system. Each request must include an `Authorization` header with a Bearer token.

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

The API token is generated during deployment and stored in the environment configuration. It can be found in the `/etc/default/hypr-visor` file on the server or by running:

```bash
grep API_TOKEN /etc/default/hypr-visor
```

<Warning>
  For security reasons, only authorized systems should have access to this token. Do not share your API token publicly.
</Warning>

## Making Authenticated Requests

Here's an example of making an authenticated request to the API:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/vms \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

```javascript Node.js
const axios = require('axios');

const response = await axios.get('http://localhost:3000/vms', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN'
  }
});
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    'http://localhost:3000/vms',
    headers={
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN'
    }
)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Error Responses

If authentication fails, the API will return a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 401,
  "message": "Unauthorized",
  "error": "Unauthorized"
}
```

Common authentication errors:

| Status Code | Error | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 401 | Missing Authorization header | The request does not include an Authorization header |
| 401 | Invalid Authorization header format | The Authorization header is not in the format `Bearer TOKEN` |
| 401 | Invalid API token | The provided token is not valid |

## Security Best Practices

To keep your Hypr-Visor deployment secure:

1. **Rotate tokens regularly**: Generate a new API token periodically
2. **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production to encrypt API traffic
3. **Limit access**: Only allow trusted systems to access the API
4. **Monitor usage**: Keep track of API usage and watch for suspicious activity

## Generating a New Token

If you need to generate a new API token, you can update the `API_TOKEN` environment variable:

```bash
# Generate a new token
NEW_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)

# Update the environment configuration
sudo sed -i "s/API_TOKEN=.*/API_TOKEN=$NEW_TOKEN/" /etc/default/hypr-visor

# Restart the service to apply the change
sudo systemctl restart hypr-visor
```

<Note>
  After changing the API token, you'll need to update all clients that use the API, including the CLI configuration.
</Note>
