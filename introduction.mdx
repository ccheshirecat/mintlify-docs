## Architecture

Hypr-Visor is built on a modern, modular architecture that leverages the best open-source technologies:

- **Firecracker**: The underlying virtualization technology that provides secure, fast microVMs
- **NestJS**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript
- **Redis**: An in-memory data structure store used for caching and pub/sub messaging
- **SQLite**: A self-contained, high-reliability, embedded SQL database engine
