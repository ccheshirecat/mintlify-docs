# VM Management

This guide covers the basics of creating and managing virtual machines (VMs) with Hypr-Visor.

## VM Lifecycle

A VM in Hypr-Visor goes through several states during its lifecycle:

1. **Creating**: The VM is being provisioned
2. **Running**: The VM is running and available
3. **Stopping**: The VM is in the process of shutting down
4. **Stopped**: The VM is shut down but can be started again
5. **Restarting**: The VM is restarting
6. **Terminating**: The VM is being deleted
7. **Failed**: The VM encountered an error

## Creating a VM

To create a VM, you need to specify its configuration, including resources, operating system, and SSH key.

<CodeGroup>
```bash API
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/vms \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-token" \
  -d '{
    "name": "web-server",
    "vcpu": 2,
    "ram_mb": 1024,
    "storage_mb": 10240,
    "os": "ubuntu",
    "ssh_key": "ssh-rsa AAAA..."
  }'
```

```bash CLI
hypr vm create \
  --name web-server \
  --vcpu 2 \
  --ram 1024 \
  --storage 10240 \
  --os ubuntu \
  --ssh-key "ssh-rsa AAAA..."
```
</CodeGroup>

### VM Configuration Options

| Parameter | Description | Default | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | Name of the VM | - | Yes |
| `vcpu` | Number of virtual CPUs | 1 | Yes |
| `ram_mb` | RAM in megabytes | 512 | Yes |
| `storage_mb` | Storage in megabytes | 5120 | Yes |
| `os` | Operating system (alpine, ubuntu, debian, etc.) | alpine | Yes |
| `ssh_key` | SSH public key for access | - | Yes |
| `tags` | Array of tags for the VM | [] | No |
| `user_id` | User ID for multi-tenant setups | - | No |

## Listing VMs

You can list all VMs to see their status and configuration.

<CodeGroup>
```bash API
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/vms \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-token"
```

```bash CLI
hypr vm list
```
</CodeGroup>

Example response:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "vm-123",
    "name": "web-server",
    "ip": "192.168.100.2",
    "status": "running",
    "vcpu": 2,
    "ram_mb": 1024,
    "storage_mb": 10240,
    "os": "ubuntu",
    "created_at": "2023-06-15T10:30:00Z",
    "tags": ["web", "production"],
    "security_groups": ["default", "web"],
    "available_actions": ["stop", "restart", "terminate"],
    "node_id": "node-1"
  }
]
```

## Getting VM Details

To get detailed information about a specific VM:

<CodeGroup>
```bash API
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/vms/vm-123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-token"
```

```bash CLI
hypr vm get vm-123
```
</CodeGroup>

## Starting a VM

To start a stopped VM:

<CodeGroup>
```bash API
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/vms/vm-123/start \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-token"
```

```bash CLI
hypr vm start vm-123
```
</CodeGroup>

## Stopping a VM

To stop a running VM:

<CodeGroup>
```bash API
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/vms/vm-123/stop \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-token"
```

```bash CLI
hypr vm stop vm-123
```
</CodeGroup>

## Restarting a VM

To restart a running VM:

<CodeGroup>
```bash API
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/vms/vm-123/restart \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-token"
```

```bash CLI
hypr vm restart vm-123
```
</CodeGroup>

## Terminating a VM

To permanently delete a VM:

<Warning>
  This action cannot be undone. All data on the VM will be lost.
</Warning>

<CodeGroup>
```bash API
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/vms/vm-123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-token"
```

```bash CLI
hypr vm terminate vm-123
```
</CodeGroup>

## Connecting to a VM

Once a VM is running, you can connect to it using SSH:

```bash
ssh -i /path/to/private/key root@192.168.100.2
```

<Note>
  The username depends on the OS image. For Alpine and Ubuntu, it's usually `root`. For other distributions, it might be different.
</Note>

## VM Tags

Tags are key-value pairs that you can attach to a VM to organize and categorize them. You can add tags when creating a VM or update them later.

<CodeGroup>
```bash API
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/vms/vm-123/tags \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-token" \
  -d '{
    "tags": ["web", "production", "customer-a"]
  }'
```

```bash CLI
hypr vm update-tags vm-123 --tags web,production,customer-a
```
</CodeGroup>

## VM Metadata

Each VM has metadata that provides additional information about the VM. You can access this metadata through the API:

<CodeGroup>
```bash API
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/vms/vm-123/metadata \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-token"
```

```bash CLI
hypr vm metadata vm-123
```
</CodeGroup>

Example response:

```json
{
  "vm_id": "vm-123",
  "hostname": "web-server",
  "ip": "192.168.100.2",
  "mac_address": "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF",
  "kernel_version": "5.4.0",
  "os_version": "Ubuntu 20.04",
  "uptime_seconds": 3600,
  "boot_time": "2023-06-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```
